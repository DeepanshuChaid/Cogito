# 🧠 Cogito — Frontend Architecture

**Next.js (App Router) + TanStack Query**

A production-grade frontend architecture built to respect a real backend:
Prisma, PostgreSQL, Redis, rate limiting, caching, and scale.

This is **scalable, and system-driven**.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Mirror backend domain logic cleanly
- Keep frontend maintainable as features grow
- Avoid over-engineering while staying future-proof
